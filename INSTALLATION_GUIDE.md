# MAC File Manager Pro - Installation Guide

## üîí macOS Security Warning

When you first try to open MAC File Manager Pro, you may see this warning:

> **"Apple could not verify 'MAC File Manager Pro.app' is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy."**

This is normal for unsigned applications and doesn't mean the app is unsafe. Here's how to safely install and run it:

## ‚úÖ Method 1: Right-Click to Open (Recommended)

1. **Download** `File Manager Pro.dmg` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/dannyallport77/mac-file-manager-pro/releases)
2. **Open the DMG** and drag `MAC File Manager Pro.app` to your Applications folder
3. **Go to Applications folder** in Finder
4. **Right-click** on `MAC File Manager Pro.app`
5. **Select "Open"** from the context menu
6. **Click "Open"** in the security dialog that appears
7. The app will now run and be trusted for future launches

## ‚öôÔ∏è Method 2: System Preferences (Alternative)

If the right-click method doesn't work:

1. Try to open the app normally (it will be blocked)
2. **Open System Preferences** ‚Üí **Security & Privacy**
3. **Click the "General" tab**
4. You'll see: *"MAC File Manager Pro.app was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer"*
5. **Click "Open Anyway"**
6. **Click "Open"** in the confirmation dialog

## üõ°Ô∏è Method 3: Terminal Command (Advanced Users)

For advanced users, you can remove the quarantine attribute:

```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/MAC File Manager Pro.app"
```

## üîê Why This Happens

- **Code Signing**: The app isn't signed with an Apple Developer Certificate ($99/year)

- **Open Source**: This is a free, open-source project without commercial code signing
